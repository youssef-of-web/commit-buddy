## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root to configure your API keys:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key-here
OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=your-qwen-api-key-here
```

1. **Groq API Key:**
   Go to your [Groq Console](your [Groq Console](https://groq.com) and generate an API key.

   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key-here
   ```

   - Or set the environment variable directly in your shell.

2. **Qwen API Key:**
   Go to openrouter.ai and generate an API key.
   ```env
   OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY=your-qwen-api-key-here
   ```

---

3. **Optional:**
   Model Provider
   By default, commit-buddy uses Groq's LLM API. You can also use Qwen by setting the environment variable.
   ```env
   MODEL_PROVIDER=qwen
   ```
